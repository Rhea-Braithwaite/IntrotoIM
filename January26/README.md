I learned from this assignment that creating a portrait using code is not an easy task, particularly as it concerns getting different angles for the different shapes. But I did figure it out. I learned how to rotate the arms and legs to the desired degree by using the rotate function. Because the shape is rotated around the origin, it was necessary to change the location of the origin from the top left corner to another coordinate using the translate function.  And finally to reset the origin, the code for the rotation had to be bracketed by the pushMatrix and popMatrix Functions.
