# April 13 - DREAMCATCHER
## Description: 
For this week's assignment I decided to do dreamcatcher themed game.As we know, dreamcatchers act as a way to catch and remove bad dreams. So for my game, the overall goal is to catch the bad dreams using the dreamcatcher which is at the bottom of the screen and and this is moved from side to side using the switches. 
 - A sun: good dream
 - An eclipse: bad dream
If a bad dream is caught the score increases by 50 points, and if a good dream reaches the bottom of the screen the bonus points increase by 20 points. The user begins the game with 5 lives and if a bad dream is not caught then a life is lost. After all lives are lost a final screen is displayed with the user's final score, and then the game begins again

## Process
### Processing Code


### Arduino Circuit
For the circuit I decided to keep things really simple and just try to see if I could obtain game functionality using the two switches.
