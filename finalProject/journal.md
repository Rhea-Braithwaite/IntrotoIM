# Final Project
## Preliminary Description
For my final project, I would like to do an Arduino and Processing Version of Guitar Hero. For guitar hero, the user simulates playing the guitar by playing the 
correct notes with the four guitar keys. Similarly for my version, the user would see on screen the notes to be played, and once they reach the bottom of the screen
the correct key (switch) must be pressed. The base music would be playing, and the user, pressing the keys would hear the actual song itself if they are pressed correctly.
The songs would be preloaded.

Arduino: The circuit would utilize four switches which would act as guitar keys. Additionally there would be the toner to play the music for the songs, as well as the notes
for the different switches

Processing: Processing would display notes, so that the user can see when to press the correct switch.
