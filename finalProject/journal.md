# Final Project
## Preliminary Description
For my final project, I would like to do an Arduino and Processing Version of Piano Tiles. Piano Tiles is a game where the user presses the black tiles on the screen at a speed and time that matches the length of the tile and the music being played. For my version I would like to do the same thing but have it insted be with switches.
So the user would see the tile/note appear on screen and when it arrives at the bottom of the screen the matching switch has to be pressed for the corresponding amount of time as the length of the note. The base music would be playing, and the user, pressing the keys would hear the actual song itself if they are pressed correctly. If the incorrect switch is pressed or a switch is not pressed the game is lost and the user can start over.
The goal is to have 2 to 3 songs that the are preloaded that the user can play, each one a bit more difficult than the next

### Arduino: The circuit would utilize:
 - four switches which would act as notes to be pressed.
 - Additionally there would be the toner to play the music for the songs, as well as the notes for the different switches.

### Processing: Processing would have display a screen of four lanes and at the bottom of the screen there would be four slots, each representing a switch. When the note is in the slot that is when the switch must be pressed. If a note has a shadow then the switch has to be presed for the length of the shadow. If the note
does not have a shadow then the switch only needs to be pressed and released.
