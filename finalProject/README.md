# Switch Notes

## Description

For my Final Project, I decided to do a Piano Tiles inspired game called Switch Notes. Piano Tiles is a game where different tiles appear to fall down the screen and the user presses them at a speed and time that matches the length of the tile and the music being played. For my version I decided to do something similar using switches. So the user sees a note which appears on the screen, falling within 1 of 4 lanes. When it arrives at the bottom of the screen, in the play zone, the matching switch is pressed. If the note is within the zone and the correct switch is pressed, then a sound is played for the using the note and the score is incremented.

If the note is enitrely in the play zone, the score increases by 100
If the note is only partly in the play zone, the score increases by 50

There are two song options
 - Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
 - Jingle Bells
 
The overarching goal is to obtain the most points possible for each song.

Additionally, it is possible for the user to change the speed of the game by using a potentiometer. This has to be done before the game begins, and the higher the speed, there is a greater amount of bonus points. 

Initally, I had planned on two more things
 - Having a sort of trail for notes with a longer length and having the user hold down the switch for the length of the trail. However, given the time constraints and my inability to come up with a solution, I decided to focus on other aspects of the project instead. 
 - Also, I had intended on having base music being played to accompany the notes, but I realized then that that was not necessary, as the notes themselves make up the essence of the song. 

would like to do the same thing but have it insted be with switches. So the user would see the tile/note appear on screen and when it arrives at the bottom of the screen, the matching switch has to be pressed for the corresponding amount of time as the length of the note. The base music would be playing, and the user, pressing the keys would hear the actual song itself if they are pressed correctly. For each correct switch that is selected and the correct length that the switch is held, the user gains points. If the incorrect switch is pressed or a switch is not pressed the game the user does not gain the points. THe overarching goal is to gain the highest score possibe, ie. pressing every switch correctly and for an accurate amount of time I would like to have 2 to 3 songs that the are preloaded that the user can play, each one a bit more difficult than the next
